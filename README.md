# Financial stability analysis

In this project, I analysed the financial health of banks using market structure
risks and datasets spanning over the past several years.
This project involved me examining interconnected liquidity, funding and
macro‑financial indicators to assess vulnerabilities in the UK financial system. Using
data sources such as Bankstats liquidity metrics, the SONIA interest rate series and
ONS Flow‑of‑Funds statistics. I then used the data I collected to forecast projections of the financial health of banks for the
next 5 years.
