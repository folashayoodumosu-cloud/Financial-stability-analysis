# Financial stability analysis

In this project, I analysed the financial health of banks using market structure
risks and datasets spanning over the past several years.
This project involved me examining interconnected liquidity, funding and
macro‑financial indicators to assess vulnerabilities in the UK financial system. Using
data sources such as Bankstats liquidity metrics, the SONIA interest rate series and
ONS Flow‑of‑Funds statistics. I then used the data I collected to forecast projections of the financial health of banks for the
next 5 years.

# Dataset Description
Firstly, I had to
determine what datasets to use and how they would provide me with insight that
align with my objective. I selected the following:
- The Bankstats Liquidity Metrics, which gave detailed information about bank’s
types of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), their mismatches in loan and
deposit maturities, as well as the trends in deposit flows and wholesale
funding. Since banks submitted their data at different times and updated
information individually, the Bankstats dataset required extensive cleaning
before it could be used accurately.
- SONIA interest rate data served as a useful indicator for understanding of
funding market conditions, the changes in monetary policy and how markets
expected interest rates to move in the future. By looking at interest rate trends
alongside liquidity data, it would be possible to spot potential links between
changes in funding costs and how that affects how much cash banks have
available (their liquidity position).
- The ONS Flow-of-Funds statistics provided a wider view of the financial
system. This data helped to reveal patterns in how money was saved per
households, how much companies were borrowing and how different parts of
the financial sector were possibly connected. This subsequently showed the
paths in which risks could spread from one sector to another.
By bringing these datasets together my analysis created a completer and more
detailed full picture of the financial system.
